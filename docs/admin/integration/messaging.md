# Run:ai Event Router

The [Run:ai Event Router](https://github.com/run-ai/event-router.git){target=_blank} repository is a wrapper chart of [kubernetes-event-exporter](https://github.com/resmoio/kubernetes-event-exporter){target=_blank} open source project configured specifically to trigger alerts from Run.Ai cluster.

!!! Note
    The Event Router currently is configured out of the box only for parsing Run:ai scheduler events to Slack.

## Configure Slack notifications

To configure Slack notifications:

1. Create a new slack app [here](https://api.slack.com/apps){target=_blank}. The slack app is used to trigger notifications to a channel and to generate auth token to the event-router.

    After pressing on the create new app button, you should have the option to create the app from an `app manifest`.

2. Copy the following slack manifest definition in order to create `runai-event-router-app`:

    ```yaml
    display_information:
      name: runai-event-router
      description: This app is used by runai-event-router for sending notifications through slack
      background_color: "#141f40"
    features:
      bot_user:
        display_name: runai-event-router-app
        always_online: false
    oauth_config:
      scopes:
        bot:
          - chat:write
          - incoming-webhook
          - chat:write.public
    settings:
      org_deploy_enabled: false
      socket_mode_enabled: false
      token_rotation_enabled: false
    ```

    After creating your app go to the "**OAuth & Permissions**" section in your app and grab the `Bot User OAuth Token`, in the following step paste the token in the values.yaml.

    !!! Note
        In order to create the slack app without a manifest you can follow slack docs: [guide to creating Slack apps with bot tokens](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics){target=_blank}.

3. Clone the [Run.Ai Event Router](https://github.com/run-ai/event-router.git){target=_blank} repository and edit the `values.yaml` file.

    ```yaml
    runaiProjects: 
      - my_runai_project
    
    clusterName: ""
    
    slack:
      enabled: true
      apiToken: ""
      channel: ""
    ```

    **runaiProjects**&mdash;projects listed here will send notifications. Use the regex pattern `.*` to find all the projects with the same starting name.

    **clusterName**&mdash;name of the cluster to show in the Slack notifications.

    **slack**

      `enabled`&mdash;Enable slack integration
  
      `apiToken`&mdash;Slack bot token, configured with '**chat:write**'
      permissions. (see previous section)
  
      `channel`&mdash;A destination channel **'runai-notifications'** a direct message '**@bob.marly**' or dynamic by setting '**pod-project**'.

      If the value of `channel` is set to pod-project, the event router will try to send the notification by tagging '**@project**' where project is taken from the 'project' label attached to your pod by runai.

4. After configuring the `values.yaml` file run the following commands to deploy the chart:

    ```sh
    chmod +x post-process.sh
    helm install runai-event-router . -n runai-monitoring --create-namespace --post-renderer ./post-process.sh
    ```
